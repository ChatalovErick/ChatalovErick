# Hi there, my name is Erick Chatalov

I'm from Portugal, I'm a Statistician/Data Scientist with an obsession in making code run faster and build algorithms that predicts or analyses trends. With a bachelor's in Applied Statistics and a master's in Biostatistics, I'm interested in applying mathematical models and AI/Machine learning solutions to modern problems.
